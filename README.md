# House Price Prediction
# Overview
The House Price Prediction project aims to forecast property values by analyzing a diverse set of features using a linear regression model. This comprehensive endeavor encompasses meticulous data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model building to ensure the highest accuracy in price predictions. Our well-refined approach strives to deliver insightful and precise valuations, making a significant impact in the housing market.
# Features
- **Data Cleaning:** Cleans and preprocesses raw housing data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzes data to understand patterns, correlations, and distributions.
- **Dummy Encoding:** Converts categorical variables into a numerical format to be used in the model.
- **Model Building:** Utilizes a Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on processed features.
# How It Works
- **Data Cleaning:** Clean and preprocess the housing dataset, handling missing values and outliers.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Explore the dataset to uncover insights and relationships between features.
- **Feature Encoding:** Apply dummy encoding to convert categorical features into numerical format.
- **Model Training:** Train a Linear Regression model on the processed dataset to predict house prices.
